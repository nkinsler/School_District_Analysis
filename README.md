# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
The School Board has requested student data related to the 9th grade of Thomas High School be replaced due to suspected academic dishonesty.  After the suspected questionable scores are removed, a new school district analysis will be performed.

### Analysis to be performed:
- Perform district summary
- Perform school summary
- Thomas High School perforamnce relative to other schools (post replacement)
- Impact of replacing 9th grade scores:
  1. Math and reading scores by grade
  2. Scores by school spending
  3. Scores by school size
  4. Scores by school type
